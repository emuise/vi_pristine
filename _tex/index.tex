\begin{abstract}
Forests with high ecological integrity have natural or near natural
ecosystem structure, function, and composition, are home to large
amounts of biodiversity, and provide integral ecosystem services.
Anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss, overexploitation, and land
use changes are leading to the degradation or loss of high integrity
forests. As a result, it is important to be able to locate and assess
the quality of forests stands across wide swaths of land. Remote sensing
is inreasingly capable of making these assessments, through new data
such as wall to wall metrics of forest structure and productivity. In
this paper, we demonstrate a method to assess similarity to known high
quality reference states using coarsened exact matching and the sigma
dissimilarity metric. Using this dissimilarity metric, we can assess how
far, in structural and functional space, every forest stand across
Vancouver Island is to a comparable forest found in the oldest and
largest protected area on the island, Strathcona Provincial Park. We
further assess how cumulative and individual anthropogenic pressures are
influencing ecological dissimilarity. We found that cumulative
anthropogenic pressures influence the vertical layering of forests
(canopy height and structural complexity), but do not influence forest
energy availability or energy seasonality. Further, individual
anthropogenic pressures increase dissimilarity for the majority of
forest structural attributes, and population density reduces similarity
to highly seasonal forests. Our results demonstrate that applying strict
matching procedures and the sigma dissimilarity metric can be used to
assess ecosystem similarity, which could be useful when examining
locations of rare ecosystems under large amounts of anthropogenic
pressure. Further, we demonstrate that vertical forest structural
attributes which area strongly related to biodiversity via niche
availability and resource partitioning are influenced negatively by
anthropogenic pressures.
\end{abstract}





\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

A global biodiversity crisis is currently underway, driven by
anthropogenic changes to natural habitats (Dirzo and Raven, 2003).
Pressures such as climate change, overexploitation, and invasive species
are leading to species extinctions (Thomas et al., 2004; Urban, 2015)
and the homogenization of biological communities (McGill et al., 2015).
The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was adopted in
December 2022 with the goal of restoring and safeguarding global
biodiversity (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2023). Targets within
this framework include restoring 30\% of all degraded ecosystems,
protecting 30\% of the Earth's terrestrial, inland water, and marine
areas, and achieving no loss of high biodiversity importance areas,
including high ecological integrity ecosystems (Convention on Biological
Diversity, 2023). In the terrestrial environment, forest biomes have
been shown to harbour the largest amount of biodiversity (Cardinale et
al., 2012; Myers, 1988; Pimm and Raven, 2000), and provide key ecosystem
services (Thompson et al., 2009). To provide these services, it is
integral that these forest ecosystems are in good ecological condition,
as represented by natural or near-natural levels of forest structure,
function, and composition, often referred to as having high ecological
integrity (Marín et al., 2021).

While understanding forest condition is a key aspect of understanding
biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services due to their
inherent linkages (Cardinale et al., 2012; Marín et al., 2021), it is
challenging to obtain suitable field-derived data across extensive land
areas due to the significant financial and temporal costs associated
with large-scale field campaigns. Remote sensing data, however, can
provide a efficient and cost-effective alternative to field data,
offering access to new spatially explicit and comprehensive datasets
that can be linked to ecological condition, with additional metrics
being proposed at a rapid pace (Pereira et al., 2013; Radeloff et al.,
2024; Skidmore et al., 2021). Advances in lidar technologies and
modelling methods are enabling the generation of wall-to-wall estimates
of forest stand structure for across entire countries (Becker et al.,
2023; Matasci et al., 2018a; Matasci et al., 2018b), which serve as a
more detailed indicator of ecosystem structure than the often previously
used landscape fragmentation metrics (Andrew et al., 2012). Productivity
metrics have been employed as a proxy for ecosystem function for many
years (Pettorelli et al., 2018, 2005), with new Landsat-derived datasets
providing integrative annual estimates of energy availability at a 30 m
spatial resolution (Radeloff et al., 2024; Radeloff et al., 2019;
Razenkova et al., n.d.). Remote sensing is quickly providing access to a
vast array of datasets suitable for monitoring the various facets of
biodiversity and ecological condition (Noss, 1990; Pereira et al., 2013;
Skidmore et al., 2021). The integration of these datasets with
information pertaining to the location of known
high-ecological-integrity forests enables researchers and managers to
identify high-quality forest reference states across entire
jurisdictions, even in the presence of anthropogenic pressures.

Ecological reference states represent baseline conditions of ecosystems,
serving as a benchmark for assessing ecological health and guiding
restoration efforts (Nielsen et al., 2007). The application of
counterfactual thinking, which entails considering the potenital state
of an ecosystem in the absence of anthropogenic pressures (Ferraro,
2009) can be instrumental for mapping high-integrity forests. Approaches
such as coarsened exact matching (Iacus et al., 2012), can be used to
facilitate comparisons between forest stands and their hypothetical
reference states. These methods account for confounding environmental
variables, thereby ensuring that all forests are compared to an
appropriate reference state. Identifying a suitable reference state can
be difficult, however there are methods which can be used to approximate
high-integrity reference conditions. Historical reference states can be
used when an ecosystem has a large depth of temporal data to compare to,
however, it is not always guaranteed that an ecosystem can be restored
to these historical norms due to changing climates (Balaguer et al.,
2014; McNellie et al., 2020). Other proposed methods for delineating
baseline conditions include protected areas (Arcese and Sinclair, 1997),
and empirical estimates of the reference state generated by modelling
outcomes (oftentimes species abundances and occurrence) in the absence
of anthropogenic disturbance (Nielsen et al., 2007).

Protected areas, specifically designed for biodiversity conservation,
are frequently faced with lower levels anthropogenic pressure as a
result of biases in their placement (Joppa and Pfaff, 2009; Muise et
al., 2022). In forested ecosystems, over time this leads to undisturbed
high-integrity forests remaining within protected areas due to their
natural disturbance regimes and a lack of anthropogenic pressures
(Brumelis et al., 2011). These high-integrity forests, situated within
protected areas, can serve as effective ecological baselines (Arcese and
Sinclair, 1997). When suitably matched to unprotected areas, they can be
used as a reference state to assess the differences between all forests
and their high-integrity counterparts (Ferraro, 2009). Further,
protected areas and undisturbed ecosystems such as intact forest
landscapes have been shown to have increased structural densities when
compared to other ecosystems (Li et al., 2023; Muise et al., 2022).

Anthropogenic pressure such as increased road densities (Nielsen et al.,
2007), harvesting and fossil fuel exploration activities leading to edge
effects (Bourgoin et al., 2024; Harfoot et al., 2018), and other
human-induced disturbances (Liira et al., 2007) have been shown to
influence forest structure. Novel datasets such as the Forest Structural
Condition Index have been developed which integrate both structure and
anthropogenic pressure into an index which identifies ecosystems of high
conservation value, with high structural complexity and low
anthropogenic pressure (Hansen et al., 2019). The impacts of
anthropocentric pressure on forest functioning and energy availability
is less frequently assessed. Hedwall et al. (2019) assessed plant
community shifts under anthropogenic pressures in the boreal forests of
Sweden, and hypothesized that changed communities may affect forest
functioning. Grantham et al. (2020) used forest extent and arrangement,
alongside pressure datasets, to assess ecosystem integrity, with
expectations that high-integrity ecosystems will retain high levels of
ecosystem functioning. However, to our knowledge, direct impacts of
anthropogenic pressures on forest ecosystem function have not been
assessed at a landscape scale.

We proposed a novel, data-driven, approach to identify high-integrity
forests based on various satellite-derived metrics of ecosystem
condition, and calculate the degree of structural and functional
similarity for unprotected areas to high-integrity forests found on
Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We use a strict matching
approach to ensure ecological similarity, and choose the highest 10\% of
metric values across variables that are known to be correlated with
ecological condition and biodiversity. We then calculate ecological
similarity using sigma dissimilarity (Mahony et al., 2017) alongside
human footprint layers developed by Hirsh-Pearson et al. (2022) to
assess the influence of anthropogenic pressure of ecological integrity
by cumulative and individual pressures. Further, we compare the
similarity metrics between ecological structure and function to identify
linkages between ecological similartiy of forest structure and forest
functioning, while accounting for the presence of anthropogenic
pressures.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Study Area}\label{study-area}

We focus on the forested areas of Vancouver Island, British Columbia,
Canada. Vancouver island has approximately 31285 km\textsuperscript{2}
of land area, of which 79.5\% is forested. The dominant forest species
on Vancouver Island are Douglas-fir (\emph{Pseudotsuga menziesii}),
western red cedar (\emph{Thuja plicata}), western hemlock (\emph{Tsuga
heterophylla}), yellow cedar (\emph{Chamaecyparis nootkatensis}), and
Sitka spruce (\emph{Picea sitchensis}) (Burns, 1990). British Columbia
generally has at temperate maritime climate, with mild, wet winters, and
cool, dry summers. There are four ecosystems on Vancouver Island as
defined by British Columbia's biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification
(BEC) framework (Pojar et al., 1987), Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH),
Mountain Hemlock (MH), Coastal Douglas Fir (CDF), and Coastal
Mountain-heather Alpine (CMA), which are broadly delineated based on
soil, climate, and elevation. Forestry is an important industry on
Vancouver Island, while fires are historically rare and low severity
(Daniels and Gray, 2006).

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

\subsubsection{Reference State}\label{reference-state}

We defined our reference state as the forested area of Strathcona Park.
We chose Strathcona Park as a temporal and protected area reference
state, as the oldest and largest (2480 km\textsuperscript{2}) protected
area in British Columbia. Strathcona Park was established in 1911, and
80\% of the park is preserved as wilderness area and designated as
Nature Conservancy Areas under the \emph{Park Act} ({``Park {Act},''}
n.d.). The park contains three BEC zones, CWH, MH, and CMA, but does not
include CDF, which is only found in the southern portion of the island.
Due to this, we do not include CDF in our analysis.

\subsubsection{Forest Structure}\label{forest-structure}

Wall-to-wall, 30 m forest structure metrics (canopy height, canopy
cover, structural complexity, and aboveground biomass) were generated by
Matasci et al. (2018a) for 2015 across the forested landscape of British
Columbia. This data was generated by using a random forest-kNN approach,
imputing airborne laser scanning derived forest structural attributes
across the entirety of Canada using Landsat-derived best-available-pixel
(BAP) composites (Hermosilla et al., 2016; White et al., 2014) and
topographic information (Matasci et al., 2018a; Matasci et al., 2018b).
The BAP composites were derived by selecting optical observations from
the Landsat archive (including Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat-7
Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager
imagery) over the course of the growing season, considering atmospheric
effects (haze, clouds, cloud shadows) and distance from the desired
composite date (in this case, August 31st). Details on the pixel scoring
method can be found in White et al. (2014). The BAP composites were
further refined by using a spectral trend analysis on the normalized
burn ratio to remove noise, and missing pixels are infilled using
temporally-interpolated values. This procedure results in gap-free,
surface-reflectance image composites (Hermosilla et al., 2015), which
are used as the primary dataset to impute forest structural attributes
(Matasci et al., 2018a; Matasci et al., 2018b).

\subsubsection{Forest Function}\label{forest-function}

For our forest ecosystem function dataset, we calculated the Dynamic
Habitat Indices (Radeloff et al., 2019) using Landsat data on Google
Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017), following the methodology of
Razenkova et al. (n.d.). Briefly, we created a synthetic year of NDVI
composites using all available Landsat imagery from 2011-2020 (centred
on 2015). We used the Landsat QA band derived from the fmask algorithm
(Zhu and Woodcock, 2012) to filter out erroneous pixels, such as clouds
and cloud shadows. Monthly NDVI values were calculated by taking the
median of each month's NDVI observations, ignoring the year the image
was acquired. This allows us to generate the DHIs at spatial resolution
of 30 m, while accounting for the lower temporal resolution of the
Landsat series when compared to the more commonly used MODIS satellites
(Razenkova et al., n.d.). The DHIs are calculated as the sum (Cumulative
DHI), minimum (Minimum DHI), and coefficient of variation (Variation
DHI) of these monthly observations. The three DHIs have been shown to be
indicative of biodiversity overa range of scales (Radeloff et al., 2019;
Razenkova et al., 2022) and extents (Coops et al., 2019, 2009) for a
variety of clades (Michaud et al., 2014; Suttidate et al., 2021). In
this study, we focus on the Cumulative and Variation DHIs, as the
minimum DHI is consistently 0 due to the presence of snow.

\subsubsection{Anthropogenic Pressures}\label{anthropogenic-pressures}

We use the Canadian Human Footprint as developed by Hirsh-Pearson et al.
(2022). The Canadian Human Footprint is an additive pressure map
generated by summing the 12 different anthropogenic pressures (built
environments, crop land, pasture land, population density, nighttime
lights, railways, roads, navigable waterways, dams and associated
reservoirs, mining activity, oil and gas, and forestry), which ranges
from zero to 55 for any cell across Canada. This cumulative dataset is
also distributed with Canada-wide individual pressure values
(Hirsh-Pearson et al., n.d.). Here, we focus on the overall cumulative
pressure map and four individual pressures: population density, built
environments, roads, and forestry. We selected these pressures as some
others (oil and gas; railroads) are not present on Vancouver Island, and
others, such as pasture land and crop land do not coincide with forested
areas.

\subsubsection{Covariates}\label{covariates}

In our matching procedure (see Section~\ref{sec-sim}) we use two core
datasets as our matching covariates. Firstly, we use a 30 m digital
elevation model and derived slope dataset from the Advanced Spaceborne
Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Version 2 GDEM
product (Tachikawa et al., 2011). We also match on four climate
variables; mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature
(MAT), mean warmest month temperature (MWMT), and mean coldest month
temperature (MCMT) calculated from 1990-2020 climate normals using the
ClimateNA software package at a 1 km spatial resolution, and downsampled
to 30 m using cubic spline resampling in the \textbf{terra} (version
1.7-71) R package (Hijmans, 2024) in R (R Core Team, 2024 version
4.4.1). A visualization of one of each input dataset can be found in
Figure Figure~\ref{fig-data}.

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Calculating similarity}\label{sec-sim}

We calculate the sigma dissimilarity (Mahony et al., 2017) of forested
pixels across British Columbia by using an expanded coarsened exact
matching (CEM) technique , Figure~\ref{fig-flow}. This methodology
enables us to evaluate the degree of similarity between all forested
pixels in the province and natural forests, while accounting for
potential confounding variables such as climate and topography. The CEM
technique creates comparable groups of observations among covariates by
initially coarsening the covariates. In this instance, all six
covariates were coarsened into five quintiles hereafter referred to as
bins. CEM then performs exact matching on the bins, with each pixel
matched to a climatically and topographically similar group of pixels
within Strathcona Park, hereafter referred to as strata. In the case
where there is not enough matched pixels found in Strathcona Park, we
calculate the nearest neighbours in bin space for all strata, and sample
up to 1000 pixels while minimizing the nearest neighbour distance. If
the nearest neighbour distance is on average above two, we do not
consider that strata in our analysis.

\phantomsection\label{cell-fig-flow}
\begin{figure}[H]

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=5.25in,height=\textheight]{strathcona/figures/flow.drawio.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-flow}Conceptual flow diagram of the study.}

\end{figure}%

Following the matching procedure, we identify data driven reference
states in both structural and functional attributes by selecting the top
10\% of protected observations for each structural (canopy height,
cover, and structural complexity) and functional (cumulative and
variation DHIs) attribute, separately. We then determine the similarity
of all pixels, in both structural and functional attributes, to the
reference states by calculating the sigma dissimilarity metric. Sigma
dissimilarity standardizes the Mahalanobian distance (Mahalanobis, 1936)
by rescaling it into percentiles of the chi distribution (Mahony et al.,
2017). This effectively accounts for the effect of dimensionality when
creating a multivariate similarity metric (Mahony et al., 2017). We
calculate sigma dissimilarity for every strata with a suitable reference
state, comparing all forested pixels to the top 10\% of each attribute
for that reference state.

\subsection{Sampling}\label{sampling}

We reclassify the Canadian Human Footprint (Hirsh-Pearson et al., n.d.;
Hirsh-Pearson et al., 2022) into categorical data following
Hirsh-Pearson et al. (2022) and Arias-Patino et al. (2024) : a value of
zero has no anthropogenic pressure, zero to four has low anthropogenic
pressure, four to eight has medium anthropogenic pressure, and
\textgreater{} eight has high anthropogenic pressure. To assess the
cumulative impact of anthropogenic pressure on ecological similarity, we
implement stratified sampling on all suitable strata, sampling 100
samples from each anthropogenic pressure class. For our individual
pressures, we follow the same reclassification steps on each pressure
layer, and sample an additional hundred samples for each pressure class.
Sampling was performed using the \textbf{sgsR} (version 1.4.5) R package
(Goodbody et al., 2023) with the Quiennec method (Queinnec et al.,
2021). Geospatial data processing was performed using the \textbf{terra}
(version 1.7-78) (Hijmans, 2024), \textbf{sf} (version 1.0-16) (Pebesma,
2018; Pebesma and Bivand, 2023), and \textbf{tidyterra} (version 0.6.1)
(Hernangómez, 2023a, 2023b) R packages.

\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}

We used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a critical value of
0.05 to identify differences in the mean similarity values across
cumulative anthropogenic pressure classes. We account for family-wise
error rate for our ANOVAs using the Holm-Bonferroni method, only
continuing the analysis for similarity variables with significant ANOVAs
at the adjusted critical value. As ANOVAs only identify if there is a
difference in means, but does not identify which means are different, we
used a Tukey HSD post-hoc test to identify which means are different
from the control group (no anthropogenic pressure), which also controls
for the family-wise error rate.

We follow the same protocol to identify the difference in means for each
anthropogenic pressure of interest (roads, population density, forestry,
and built environment). We compare each pressure to the same `no
pressure' values sampled in the cumulative pressure analysis. All
statistical analysis were conducted using the \textbf{rstatix} (version
0.7.2) R package (Kassambara, 2023).

\section{Results}\label{results}

Our sigma dissimilarity processing workflow resulted in six island wide
maps of structural and functional similarity to the reference state
found in Strathcona Provincial Park (Figure~\ref{fig-regional}). We
display three selected subsets of Vancouver Island to demonstrate
variation in similarity and the anthorpogenic footprint layers. Subset A
shows a region near Lake Cowichan where harvesting is a common
anthropogenic pressure (Figure~\ref{fig-regional} A). Subset B shows a
protected area near Campbell River with high population density
(Figure~\ref{fig-regional} B). Subset C shows a region with generally
low anthropogenic pressure (Figure~\ref{fig-regional} C). We see more
variation in the similarity to high aboveground biomass and functional
reference states, while the similarity to canopy cover, canopy height,
and structural complexity is often lower across Vancouver Island.

We found that similarity to high structural complexity (Anova: p =
0.007) and tall canopy height (Anova: p = 0.003) reference states was
influenced by medium to high levels of cumulative anthropogenic pressure
(Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-overall}). Similarity to high biomass (Anova: p
= 0.142) and canopy cover (Anova: p = 0.855) regions were not
significantly influenced by cumulative anthropogenic pressures. Neither
of the productivity metrics were influenced by cumulative anthropogenic
pressures.

Increases in all individual anthropogenic pressures led to increased
dissimilarity when compared to most structural reference states
(Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-individual}). Increases in pressures from roads
and built environment did not increase or reduce similarity to
structural reference states with high canopy cover. Medium and high
pressures from population density and forestry/harvesting increased
dissimilarity to all structural reference states. Anthropogenic
pressures generally did not influence the similarity to reference states
based on productivity metrics, however, increases in pressures from
population density decreased dissimilarity to ecosystems with high
variation in energy availability.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

In this paper, we use medium-resolution remote sensing metrics of
ecosystem structure and function to assess similarity to high-integrity
forests across Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We validate our
approach by assessing the influence of the human footprint on these
reference states, finding that ecosystem structure in the form of forest
structural attributes is influenced by increased anthropogenic pressures
on a cumulative and individual level (Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-overall};
Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-individual}). Forest ecosystem function, as
represented by the DHIs, is generally not significantly influenced by
anthropogenic pressures, although population density increased
similarity to ecosystems with high variation in energy availability
(Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-individual}).

We find that similarity to high structural complexity forests, which are
often high in biodiversity due to increased niche availability
(Macarthur and Macarthur, 1961; Walter et al., 2021), is impacted by
medium to high levels of anthropogenic pressures. Structural similarity
to tall forests is also impacted by medium to high levels of
anthropogenic pressure, while productivity metrics were not influenced
by cumulative anthropogenic pressures in this region
(Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-overall}). In tropical forests, Bourgoin et al.
(2024) found that anthropogenic forest degradation influenced
aboveground biomass and canopy height, however, they focus on edge
effects, fire, and selective logging, rather than cumulative and
individual anthropogenic pressures. Li et al. (2023) also found a global
impact of anthropogenic pressures on forest structural density, however,
they do not explore which facets of anthropogenic pressure are the
strongest driver of forest degradation. Hansen et al. (2020) integrate
forest structure and anthropogenic pressure into the forest structural
integrity index to identify forest stands of high ecological value (high
structural quality; low anthropogenic footprint). We further this
research by assessing individual pressures on a multivariate metric of
structural similarity to a high-quality reference state
(Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-individual}).

It is possible that we did not find a relationship between cumulative
anthropogenic pressures and canopy cover/aboveground biomass as these
forest structural attributes are typically high on Vancouver Island due
to the regions mild climate and suitability for forest growth (Waring et
al., 2006). Conversely, we did find a relationship between the vertical
layering (canopy height and structural complexity) of trees and
anthropogenic pressures (Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-overall}). This is
especially relevant as structurally complex forests are crucial for
harbouring biodiversity and providing ecosystem functions and services.
The lack of a relationship between canopy cover/aboveground biomass and
the cumulative human footprint is potentially due to replanting efforts
from the forestry industry following harvest, which are required in
British Columbia and often lead to single species, single aged stands
(Lieffers et al., 2020). Stands of this configuration are unlikely to be
found in our reference state, Strathcona Provincial Park, as it has been
a protected area for over 100 years, thus leading to higher
dissimilarity values.

Anthropogenic effects on forest function and energy availability have
rarely been examined. Here, we also examine how anthropogenic pressures
influence similarity to high available energy and high energy variation
forests, both hypothesized to indicate high levels of biodiversity in a
number of guilds and clades (Radeloff et al., 2019; Razenkova et al.,
2022). We do not find a strong influence of cumulative anthropogenic
pressure on our forest functioning metrics, however, we did find that
similarity to forest stands with high annual energy variability was
increased in high population density areas
(Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-individual}). This increase in similarity in
high density areas is potentially driven by ornamental trees and the
bias for North American urban forests to be primarily deciduous trees
(Clapp et al., 2014; Roman et al., 2018), which would have a stronger
variation DHI component due to annual leaf senescence and green-up.

Further, the calculation of the DHIs is dependent on using a vegetation
index or productivity estimate, in our case NDVI. Vegetation indices
have been shown to saturate at high levels of canopy cover and leaf area
index (Huete et al., 2002; Huete et al., 1997), which are common on
Vancouver Island, and comparisons of unprotected areas to the highest
10\% cover in reference states shows no significant difference
(Figure~\ref{fig-boxplot-overall}). Recent research has shown that
seasonality, here represented as the Variation DHI, drives functional
diversity in avian assemblages, however, these results also strongly
varied by region (Keyser et al., 2024). It is possible that examining
anthropogenic pressure impacts in regions with more variation in canopy
cover may lead to differing results depending on the amount of total
variation present in canopy cover, which would in turn influence
seasonality and energy availability.

Assessing individual pressure influences on the environment is also
relevant to questions of how cumulative anthropogenic pressure maps are
calculate. There is currently a debate between additive and antagonistic
anthropogenic pressure mapping methods, as there is little information
on mechanistic interactions between pressures (Arias-Patino et al.,
2024). We assess individual pressures on structural and functional
similarity in forests across Vancouver Island, Canada, an advancement
upon the current standard of using a single value of cumulative
anthropogenic pressure (Bourgoin et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023). Similar
methods could be used to examine mechanistic pressure interactions
across large scales.

We apply the Sigma Dissimilarity metric developed by Mahony et al.
(2017) to determine similarity to high-integrity ecosystems, and use a
matching approach to account for environmental covariates. This method
accounts for the multidimesnionality of the structure and function
datasets, and standardizes them so they are comparable. This is
especially relevant in our case as we use four forest structural
attributes and two forest function metrics. These methods are similar to
other similarity metrics commonly applied in remote sensing for
multivariate similarity such as spectral similarity (Schweiger et al.,
2018), and phenospectral similarity (Osei Darko et al., 2024).

While we are limited in number of structural variables due to the
imputation of the lidar-derived dataset across the study area (Matasci
et al., 2018a; Matasci et al., 2018b), future studies could directly use
raw lidar datasets to create a multitude of metrics, and apply the sigma
similarity method to those. This could capture additional facets of
similarity which are missed when using a Canada-wide dataset with
limited forest structural attributes at 30 m. New spaceborne lidar
missions such as GEDI (Dubayah et al., 2020) and IceSAT-II (Neumann et
al., 2019) are also providing estimates of forest structure across the
globe. However, these satellites are sample based missions, and do not
provide wall-to-wall coverage (Duncanson et al., 2021).

We assess multiple definitions of high quality forest across a large
region using a data-driven approach. Often, it is common for reference
states to be unavailable due to a lack of data on regions of high
ecological integrity, especially across large regions (McNellie et al.,
2020). We attempt to circumvent this by using a large, long-established
protected area (Strathcona Provincial Park; Figure~\ref{fig-study}), and
a matching technique that preserves ecological similarity between
reference states and their counterparts. The long-established, large
protected area ensures that little anthropogenic pressures or
modification have been made to the landscape, while also guaranteeing
that the reference state is attainable for a given topography and
climate (Corlett, 2016; Hobbs et al., 2014) due to contemporary nature
of the reference state. Our matching technique (coarsened exact
matching, combined with an kNN approach when no exact match is
available) allows us to generate reference states in a near wall-to-wall
fashion, which ensures similarity between reference state and compared
pixels.

Our techniques move beyond traditional impact evaluation techniques
(Ferraro, 2009) commonly used in protected area effectiveness
assessments by allowing spatial reconstruction of conservation outcomes,
and generating a multivariate, rather than univariate, assessment of
similarity to high ecological integrity forests. While our methods in
this paper use a data-driven approach to derive reference states, if an
individual or organization is interested in a specific species or
ecosystem, and has known locations of high quality ecosystems associated
with that species or ecosystem, these methods can be applied to assess
similarity to those high quality ecosystems across large regions.
