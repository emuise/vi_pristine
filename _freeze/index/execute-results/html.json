Notably, our method does not require the use of known reference states beyond the protected area system. Rather, we use a strict matching approach to ensure ecological similarity, and choose the highest 10% of metric values across variables that are known to be correlated with ecological condition and biodiversity.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study Area\n\nVancouver island description\n\nWe chose six protected areas and their surrounding environments to focus on (Table)\n\nTable showing covariate ranges for PA, based on size, age\n\nStrathcona - 247959ha\n\nLower Nimpkish - Wilderness Park; 238ha\n\nMisty Lake ecological reserve; 74ha\n\nTsitika Mountain ecological reserve + surrounding parks\n\nsan juan ridge ecological reserve: 96ha\n\nJuan de Fuca\n\n### Data\n\n#### Forest Structure\n\n#### Forest Function\n\n#### Covariates\n\n### Calculating similarity\n\nWe developed a data-driven approach to identify natural forests across the province, by implementing an extended coarsened exact matching (CEM) technique [@iacus2012]. This methodology enables us to evaluate the degree of similarity between all forested pixels in the province and natural forests, while accounting for potential confounding variables such as climate and topography. Briefly, the CEM technique creates comparable groups of observations among covariates by initially coarsening the covariates. In this instance, all six covariates were coarsened into 10 quantiles hereafter referred to as bins. As an example, elevation observations in the 0-10th percentile would be grouped into elevation bin one, the 10th-20th percentile of observations into bin two, and so on. Subsequently, the CEM technique performs exact matching on the coarsened covariates, and any unmatched samples are discarded. Following the matching, we identify data driven reference states in both structural and functional attributes by selecting the top 10% of observations for structure (canopy height, cover, and structural complexity) and function (cumulative and variation DHIs). We then determine the similarity of all pixels, in both structural and functional attributes, to the reference states by calculating the Mahalanobis distance [@mahalanobis1936generalized], a multivariate distance that accounts for covariation in the data. Running this analysis for every strata ensure that each forest stands environmental conditions are similar to its reference state. In the case of strata with a small number of observations, where it is not possible to calculate the top 10% of observations, the smaller strata are grouped with the nearest neighbour in bin space. This guarantees that every pixel has a suitable reference state, and that no pixels or strata are dropped from the analysis.\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-flow .cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"E:/Sync/Masters/04_vi_pristine/figures/flow.drawio.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Conceptual flow diagram of the study.](figures/flow.drawio.png){#fig-flow width=262}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur approach differs from the standard CEM in that we do not discard unmatched samples. In lieu of this, our approach groups the unmatched strata with their nearest neighbor in quantile space, selecting a minimum of 30 samples, while minimizing the overall nearest neighbor distance between strata. We then subset\n\nWe refer to the group of matched treated/untreated samples as strata. Our method combines the advantages of CEM [no bias checking, simple computation @iacus2012], with the ability to generate wall-to-wall comparisons of our treated cells to all other cells in the province. We chose to base our matching methodology on CEM because it ensures comparable environmental conditions, whereas other methods, such as propensity score matching, ensure a similar probability of being included as a treatment sample (in our case corresponding to natural forests), but do not guarantee similar environmental conditions.\n\n#### Validation\n\nHuman footprint; disturbed areas; KBAs? Ecological reserves\n\n## Results\n\n4 panel figure showing structural/functional similar as a function of the human footprint/disturbance as validation\n\nMultipanel map (6 parks) showing identified locations for natural structure/function, and the distance of all other pixels within the PA/GPE\n\nFigure showing similarity as distance from protected area?\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe assess multiple definitions of high quality forest using a data-driven approach across a range of metrics.\n\nBenefits of using this matching approach, accounts for environmental conditions. NN-based matching on the bins allows us to generate a wall-to-wall map of naturalness, while controlling for as many confounders as possible.\n\nOur definitions of natural forests may miss some high quality ecosystems, such as sparsely treed, high elevation forests (example of whitebark pine). we attempt to account for this via our strict matching procedure which ensures that these ecosystems are matched similarly to one another. Further, 30 m satellite data is likely to miss these sparsely treed areas to begin with\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
